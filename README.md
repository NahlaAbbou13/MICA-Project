# MICA project : Matlab Interface for a Cardiac Analyst

This project addresses the problem of automated diagnosis of cardiac pathologies, via the signals provided by electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement devices.
The main purpose of this project is to implement basic signal processing algorithms using Matlab to detect some cardiac pathologies, and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to load, process and display ECG, in order to help clinicians through their diagnosis.
